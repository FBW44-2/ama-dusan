## Ask me anything!
​
I don't get a lot of questions by email. But in case you have one or more you can ask me here.. This way anyone can read the answer!
​
Anything means anything. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.
​
### Guidelines
​
- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.
